    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a Software Engineer from Milan, Italy. I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.
        My thesis was about camera-based localization for an autonomus race car that participated
        to the <a href="https://www.indyautonomouschallenge.com/">Indy Autonomous Challenge</a>.
        Since then, I have been working in the field of uncrewed ground vehicles, specializing in 
        Human Machine Interface (HMI) design and development for remote control and monitoring of autonomous
        systems. My core skills include software development, user interface design, and system integration.
        I recently started exploring the field of web development, by enrolling in the
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=Search_DSA_Beta_Prof_la.EN_cc.ROW-English&campaigntype=Search&portfolio=ROW-English&language=EN&product=Course&test=&audience=DSA&topic=&priority=Beta&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_162511579404_._ad_696197165421_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-1677053911088_._li_1008529_._pd__._&matchtype=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21168154305&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhafEBhCcARIsAEGZEKJJNe6VAvW5-g91_qZ0FysFxB76IFwzAFOqtzAdoxuV6GFsN-YSyssaAhiSEALw_wcB&couponCode=PMNVD3025">Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp</a>
