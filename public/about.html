    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hi! I'm Samu, a software engineer now learning about creating engaging and interactive websites.</p>
    <p>
        I was born in Milan, Italy. I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.
        Since then, I have lived in different cities around Italy, including Bozen and Modena. 
        I like to travel and explore new places, I have visited many countries in Europe, and I have also
        been to the United States and Australia. In the photo you can see me on harbour of South Perth,
        where I spent a few weeks visiting my relatives and enjoying the amazing landscapes of Western Australia.
